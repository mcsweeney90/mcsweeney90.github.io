I am a third year PhD student in the School of Mathematics at the University of Manchester, supervised by [Neil Walton](https://sites.google.com/site/neilwaltonswebsite/home) and co-supervised by [Nick Higham](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~higham/) and [Mawussi Zounon](https://mawussi.github.io/). 

I am a member of the School's [Numerical Linear Algebra](https://nla-group.org/) group. 


My research
======

Modern high-performance computing (HPC) architectures are increasingly likely to be heterogeneous, comprising multiple powerful accelerators, usually GPUs, in addition to a host of multicore CPUs. But to exploit the awesome potential of such systems, we must ensure that the constituent tasks of computational jobs are executed by the processing resources which are best suited to handle them. 

My research is focused on developing effective new strategies for doing exactly this.  



Academic interests
======
* Numerical analysis.
* High-performance computing.
* Task-based programming.
* Scheduling.
* Numerical algorithms and software.
* Machine learning (especially reinforcement learning).

Other interests
======

During the 2017/18 academic year, I was the Treasurer of the [University of Manchester SIAM-IMA Student Chapter](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~siam/). 

For several years I have been a volunteer for the [British Heart Foundation](https://www.bhf.org.uk/).
