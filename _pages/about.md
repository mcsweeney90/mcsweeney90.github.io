I am a second year PhD student in the School of Mathematics at the University of Manchester, supervised by [Neil Walton](https://sites.google.com/site/neilwaltonswebsite/home) and co-supervised by [Nick Higham](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~higham/) and [Mawussi Zounon](https://mawussi.github.io/). 

My research
======

Modern high-performance computing (HPC) architectures are becoming increasingly heterogeneous (for example, with multiple CPUs and GPUs), so one of the major current challenges is to ensure that tasks are assigned to the computational resources which are best suited to handle them. 

The fundamental goal of my research is to develop effective strategies for scheduling the constituent tasks of large computational jobs on heterogeneous HPC systems.  

One interesting avenue I am currently investigating is how we can apply techniques from reinforcement learning that have recently found success in other areas to this task scheduling problem.
