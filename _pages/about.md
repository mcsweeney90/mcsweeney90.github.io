I am a second year PhD student in the School of Mathematics at the University of Manchester, supervised by [Neil Walton](https://sites.google.com/site/neilwaltonswebsite/home) and co-supervised by [Nick Higham](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~higham/) and [Mawussi Zounon](https://mawussi.github.io/). 

I am a member of the School's [Numerical Linear Algebra](https://nla-group.org/) group. 


My research
======

Modern high-performance computing (HPC) architectures are becoming increasingly heterogeneous (for example, with multiple CPUs and GPUs), so one of the major current challenges is to ensure that tasks are assigned to the computational resources which are best suited to handle them. 

The fundamental goal of my research is to develop effective strategies for scheduling the constituent tasks of large computational jobs on heterogeneous HPC systems.  

One interesting avenue I am currently investigating is the application of reinforcement learning methods to this task scheduling problem. 


Academic interests
======

* Numerical algorithms and software.
* Machine learning.

Other interests
======

During the 2017/18 academic year, I was the Treasurer of the [University of Manchester SIAM-IMA Student Chapter](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~siam/). 

In my spare time, I sometimes try my hand at coding challenges such as those found at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about).

For several years I have been a volunteer for the [British Heart Foundation](https://www.bhf.org.uk/).
